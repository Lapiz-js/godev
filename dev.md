## Dev Notes

### Linter
I'd like to get a javascript linter in this. I'd prefer one in Go, but maybe
I could just embed the Crockford lint and make it easy to open the pages in
there.

### Server side tests
I may be able to use something like https://github.com/robertkrimen/otto to
run the tests in Go. If I had a linter, that would be greate because I could
actually link everything to the build command.
