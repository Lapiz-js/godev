## godev

This repo is for working on Lapiz-JS using Go for server side tasks. I haven't
done a great job of cleaning up the code. I'm just looking for it to work. I'll
try to get goaddtestcoverate and goautodoc cleaned up eventually. But for now,
everything seems to work and that's a big step forward.

This repo is not intended for running go install, instead just go get it and
run it from inside directory. Again, I may clean this up later, but it works for
now.
